Clearly the demons see no issue with using every resource they can against their enemies.\n\nWhile visually terrifying, demon spawners have no means of moving or directly defending themselves. Their considerable mass makes them hard to kill quickly however, and they will spawn ripper demons more quickly when they are under threat.\n\n_Demon spawners seem to be connected to some central source of demonic power.

actors.mobs.dm100.desc=The DM-100 is an early model of dwarven 'defense machine' which was designed to protect dwarven miners in the caves below this prison.

actors.mobs.dm200.desc=The DM-200 is the second generation of dwarven 'defense machine', which was designed to protect dwarven miners in the caves and city below. They are much larger and bulkier than their predecessors, and attack with devastating hydraulic fists.\n\nTheir increased size is also their primary weakness, as they are unable to fit into the narrow tunnels and doorways of the dungeon. The dwarves were able to compensate for the DM-200's lack of mobility by allowing them to vent their toxic exhaust fumes at distant enemies, or enemies they cannot reach.

actors.mobs.dm201.name=DM-201
actors.mobs.dm201.vent=The DM-201 lobs a corrosive grenade!
actors.mobs.dm201.desc=The dwarves briefly experimented with more heavily emphasizing the DM-200's lack of mobility and created some DM models that are entirely stationary. The DM-201 is a retrofitted DM-200 which acts as a sentry turret that has no movement ability. In exchange for the lack of mobility, DM-201s have significantly more durability and attacking power.\n\nAs DM-201s have no engine to vent exhaust from, the dwarves instead outfitted them with corrosive gas grenades! DM-201s are careful with these grenades however, and will only lob them when attacked from a distance.

actors.mobs.dm300.defeated=CRITICAL DAMAGE! ATTEMPTING SHUTDO-
actors.mobs.dm300.desc=The DM-300 is the largest and most powerful 'defense machine' that the dwarves ever built. Such an awesome machine is difficult to manufacture, so the dwarves only ever made a few to guard the entrances to their underground metropolis.\n\nIt is equipped with vents to jet its toxic exhaust fumes and a high power drill that it can use both to attack and disrupt the earth. DM-300 can also connect to an energy grid, further enhancing its power.
actors.mobs.dm300.desc_supercharged=DM-300 is currently charged full of electrical energy. In this form DM-300 cannot be damaged and moves at double speed! Additionally, its drill now spins fast enough for it to _tunnel through solid rock,_ though it moves much more slowly when doing this.\n\nAttacking DM-300 directly is pointless while it is supercharged, but _something in the area must be providing it with this energy,_ destroying that may weaken it.

actors.mobs.dwarfking.rankings_desc=Fell Before the King of Dwarves
actors.mobs.dwarfking.desc=Many years ago one of the highest wizards in the dwarven court uncovered secrets which gave him tremendous power over life and death. He soon put this power to use, subjugating and corrupting his peers, his king, and eventually every dwarven citizen. Now he is king, ruler over a legion of undead subjects.\n\nThe King of Dwarves is an aggressive foe, who will attempt to surround and overwhelm his enemies with his horde of undead minions.\n\nHe seems oddly obsessed with proving he is a better king than Rat King.

actors.mobs.eye.deathgaze_kill=The deathgaze killed you...
actors.mobs.eye.desc=Evil Eyes are floating balls of pent up demonic energy. While they are capable of melee combat, their true strength comes from their magic.\n\nAfter building energy for a short time an Evil Eye will unleash a devastating beam of energy called the _deathgaze._ Anything (including kings) within the Evil Eye's sights will take tremendous damage, wise adventurers will run for cover.

actors.mobs.fetidrat.name=fetid rat
actors.mobs.fetidrat.desc=Something is clearly wrong with this rat. Its greasy black fur and rotting skin are very different from the healthy rats you've seen previously. Its pale green eyes make it seem especially menacing.\n\nIf the sight of a previously loyal subject being corrupted so completely wasn't enough to bring you to tears, the rat carries a cloud of horrible stench with it that almost certainly will. It's overpoweringly strong up close.\n\nDark ooze dribbles from the rat's mouth, it eats through the floor but seems to dissolve in water.

actors.mobs.ghoul.name=dwarven ghoul
actors.mobs.ghoul.desc=As dwarven society slowly began to collapse, and the current king of the dwarves seized absolute power, those who were weak or who resisted him were not treated well. As the king grew more adept at wielding dark magic, he bent these dwarves to his will, and now they make up the footsoldiers of his army.\n\nGhouls are not especially strong on their own, but always travel in groups and are much harder to kill in large numbers. _When a ghoul is defeated, it will rise again after a few turns as long as another ghoul is nearby._

actors.mobs.gnoll.name=gnoll scout
actors.mobs.gnoll.desc=Gnolls are hyena-like humanoids. They dwell in sewers and dungeons, venturing up to raid the surface from time to time. Perhaps sensing a weakness in the Rat Kingdom, these raids have become so common that it's starting to feel more like an invasion. Good thing you're here to teach them whose boss!\n\nGnoll scouts are regular members of their pack, they are not as strong as brutes and not as intelligent as shamans.

actors.mobs.gnolltrickster.name=gnoll trickster
actors.mobs.gnolltrickster.desc=A strange looking creature, even by gnoll standards. It hunches forward with a wicked grin, almost cradling the satchel hanging over its shoulder. Once the most notorious gnoll assassin in the land, it seems it has lost most of its sanity to all the dark magic around here, making it even more dangerous than the previous times he's attempted to take His Royal Rattiness's life. Its eyes are wide with a strange mix of fear and excitement, it seems that is all it can feel anymore... But why should I be feeling bad for an assassin?\n\nThere is a large collection of poorly made darts in its satchel, they all seem to be tipped with various harmful substances.

actors.mobs.goldenmimic.name=golden mimic
actors.mobs.goldenmimic.desc=Mimics are magical creatures which can take any shape they wish. In dungeons they almost always choose a shape of a treasure chest, in order to lure in unsuspecting adventurers.\n\nGolden mimics are tougher mimics which try to attract the strongest adventurers.

actors.mobs.golem.name=golem
actors.mobs.golem.def_verb=blocked
actors.mobs.golem.desc=Golems are an attempt to correct the previous flaws in dwarven machinery via the dwarves newfound use of magic. They are much more compact and efficient compared to the DM-300 while still being very deadly.\n\nWhile golems are still too large to fit into passageways, the dwarves have given them new magical abilities to compensate. Golems can teleport themselves between rooms, and teleport enemies to them when they are out of reach.

actors.mobs.goo.gluuurp=GLUUUURP!
actors.mobs.goo.rankings_desc=Absorbed by the Goo
actors.mobs.goo.desc=Little is known about The Goo. It's quite possible that it is not even a creature, but rather a conglomerate of vile substances from the sewers that somehow gained basic intelligence. Regardless, dark magic is certainly what has allowed Goo to exist.\n\nIts gelatinous nature has let it absorb lots of dark energy, you feel a chill just from being near. If Goo is able to attack with this energy you won't live for long.

actors.mobs.greatcrab.blocked=blocked
actors.mobs.greatcrab.def_verb=blocked
actors.mobs.greatcrab.desc=Once known as the Crab King, this crab no longer appears to respond to reason thanks to the invading dark magic. It is attacking a previously steadfast ally, a true shame considering the long history it has with the majestic King of Rats...\n\nThis crab is gigantic, even compared to other sewer crabs. Its blue shell is covered in cracks and barnacles, showing great age. Unfortunately the wisdom that Rat King most treasured from his fellow king is long gone, however. It lumbers around slowly, barely keeping balance with its massive claw.\n\nWhile the crab only has one claw, its size easily compensates. The crab holds the claw in front of any threat, shielding itself behind an impenetrable wall of carapace. However, the crab cannot block attacks it doesn't see coming, or attacks from multiple enemies at once.

actors.mobs.guard.def_verb=blocked
actors.mobs.guard.desc=Once keepers of the prison, these guards have long since become no different than the inmates.

So great is their devotion that they have totally surrendered their minds to their king, and now roam the dwarvern city like mindless zombies.\n\nMonks rely solely on the art of hand-to-hand combat, and are able to use their unarmed fists both for offense and defense. When they become focused, monks will parry the next physical attack used against them, even if it was otherwise guaranteed to hit. Monks build focus more quickly while on the move, and more slowly when in direct combat.
