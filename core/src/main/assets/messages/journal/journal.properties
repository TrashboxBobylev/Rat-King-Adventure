journal.document.adventurers_guide.title=Tome of Dungeon Mastery
journal.document.adventurers_guide.intro.title=Introduction
journal.document.adventurers_guide.intro.body=Greetings Adventurer, you are reading the Tome of Dungeon Mastery. This book is full of tips and tricks from the glorious rat himself to help budding adventurers survive and excel!\n\nThis guide is best used as a reference, and will magically let you know when is the best time to read each page.\n\n(Whenever the journal icon at the top-right blinks, the guidebook has something to tell you! Some pages seem to be ripped out of the book though, perhaps you can find them in the dungeon?)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.examining.title=Examining
journal.document.adventurers_guide.examining.body=No matter how powerful you are, rushing into enemies is almost never the best way to deal with them. It's important to study your opponents and surroundings to learn how to defeat them!\n\nExamining things also takes no time, so get in the habit of doing it to everything new you encounter.\n\n(You can examine something by using the magnifying glass button, and selecting the thing you want to examine. You can also examine buffs or debuffs by selecting their icons.)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.surprise_attacks.title=Surprise Attacks
journal.document.adventurers_guide.surprise_attacks.body=Rather than leaving combat up to chance, you can guarantee a hit on an enemy by using a surprise attack! This is especially useful against evasive enemies like snakes and wraiths.\n\nYou can surprise enemies by attacking them when they haven't seen you, or by using a door. If an enemy chases you through a door you can attack them right after they enter it and catch them by surprise!
journal.document.adventurers_guide.identifying.title=Identifying Items
journal.document.adventurers_guide.identifying.body=You won't know all of the properties of some items when you first find them.\n\nThe colors of potions and symbols on scrolls are different in each dungeon. Unidentified equipment can be upgraded or enchanted if you're lucky, or it might be cursed!\n\nIntuition talents and scrolls of identify, upgrade, or remove curse are very useful if you want to reduce the risk of using unidentified equipment.\n\n(You can find a list of all the items you've identified in the items tab of your journal)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.food.title=Dealing with Hunger
journal.document.adventurers_guide.food.body=Rationing food effectively is one of the best things you can do to improve your odds of survival. Try thinking of health and hunger as resources that need to be managed, not kept full at all times.\n\nWhen you aren't starving you will slowly regenerate health. So if you eat at full health, this regeneration will be wasted.\n\nIf you pace out when you eat based on how your health is doing, your food should last much longer.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.alchemy.title=Alchemy & Trinkets
journal.document.adventurers_guide.alchemy.body=If you don't find a certain consumable item useful, you can use it as an ingredient at an alchemy pot instead! Items can be used in specific recipes, or turned into all-purpose alchemical energy. Energizing potions and scrolls also identifies them!\n\nTrinkets are the only piece of equipment that can be made using alchemy. They produce a variety of helpful effects and can be made with just a bit of alchemical energy and a magical catalyst. Trinkets can be upgraded with more energy to make their effect more powerful.\n\n(You can find the first alchemy pot on the 3rd or 4th floor of the dungeon. You can find pages of an alchemy recipe book near these pots as well.)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.dieing.title=Handling Defeat
journal.document.adventurers_guide.dieing.body=Unfortunately, dungeoneering is a very dangerous profession--even for kings--and most adventurers will eventually meet their demise.\n\nWhile luck can definitely play a role, the best adventurers are the ones who use every little trick to improve their odds of success.\n\n(Don't be dissuaded if you are dying a lot, this game is hard! Focus on learning the game and steadily improving, don't focus on winning right away.\n\nDo note there are LOTS of said tricks. You really shouldn't be losing unless you subject yourself to challenges.)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.searching.title=Searching
journal.document.adventurers_guide.searching.body=Dungeons are full of secret doorways and traps which appear invisible at first glance. Searching takes time, but is very useful if you suspect something is hidden.\n\nSearch near walls if you suspect a door is hidden, or around floors if you suspect a trap is hidden.\n\n(You can search all the tiles around you by using the magnifying glass button twice. Anything that's hidden in these tiles will be revealed. Maybe there are some hidden doors near where you found this page!)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.strength.title=Strength
journal.document.adventurers_guide.strength.body=There won't be any time to train with weapons and armor you find in the dungeon, so you'll need brute strength to use them effectively.\n\nPotions of strength and scrolls of upgrade are the most effective way to meet the strength requirements of higher tier gear.\n\nIt's important to work towards using high tier items, but don't completely ignore equipment you can use sooner. Once you're deep enough in the dungeon you'll need high tier gear to survive, but you have to survive long enough to equip them first!
journal.document.adventurers_guide.upgrades.title=Upgrades
journal.document.adventurers_guide.upgrades.body=The deeper you go into a dungeon, the more important it is that you're using magically enhanced high tier gear.\n\nHigher tier weapons and armor gain more power from upgrades, but you'll also need the strength to use them properly. Wands, rings, and artifacts don't need strength, but have limited usages or don't help as directly in combat.\n\nMaking good choices about what you upgrade is very important for surviving early in the dungeon, and for setting yourself up for success later in the dungeon.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.looting.title=Effective Looting
journal.document.adventurers_guide.looting.body=Specific rooms will often contain better loot. Some of these rooms will be behind locked doors, or will contain obstacles which must be overcome.\n\nWhenever an obstacle blocks your progress, look for a solution nearby. You can usually find an item to help you on the same floor.\n\nPotions of strength and scrolls of upgrade are an excellent benchmark of how well you're exploring and looting. You will be able to find 2 potions of strength and 3 scrolls of upgrade in each five floor dungeon region.\n\n(You can see a list of important landmarks and unused keys in the notes tab of the journal window.)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.levelling.title=Gaining Experience
journal.document.adventurers_guide.levelling.body=Your experience level boosts your accuracy, evasion, health, and awards talent points. All of these can make a big difference in combat. It's best to have at least one level for each floor of the dungeon.\n\nIt can be tempting to rush through a dungeon, avoiding exploration and combat, but doing so will deprive you of both supplies and experience.\n\n(You can see information about your hero, including exp, on the status pane at the corner of the game interface. Select your hero portrait to get even more info.)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.positioning.title=Positioning
journal.document.adventurers_guide.positioning.body=Effectively fighting enemies depends on good strategy as well as strong equipment. Bad situations like getting surrounded can usually be avoided with good positioning.\n\nFor instance, most dungeons have thin corridors, which are excellent at forcing enemies to fight you one at a time. These corridors often have doorways too, which can be used for surprise attacks!\n\nThere are lots of little ways to use environmental features like grass, water, or traps to your advantage as well.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.magic.title=Magical Attacks
journal.document.adventurers_guide.magic.body=Magical attacks cut right through armor and are extremely difficult to dodge. This means that your wands will be very reliable, but also makes magical enemies extremely dangerous!\n\nMagical attacks always have a drawback though. Wands have limited charges and magical enemies usually won't be able to use their magic in close range.\n\nWhen facing enemies that use magic it is important to learn how to prevent them from using it on you.

journal.document.alchemy_guide.title=Alchemy Guide
journal.document.alchemy_guide.potions.title=Intro and Potions
journal.document.alchemy_guide.potions.body=Welcome to Practical Applications of Alchemy!\n\nAlchemy recipes can be used to craft a wide variety of items at an alchemy pot. You can experiment to find recipes, or continue reading this book for a full recipe reference!\n\nWe will start with the most iconic alchemy recipe: Place any three seeds into an alchemy pot to brew a random potion!\n\nEvery seed has a potion counterpart, and the potion you create may relate to one of the seeds used. Using multiple of the same seed will increase the chance for this to occur.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.stones.title=Creating Runestones
journal.document.alchemy_guide.stones.body=Mixing a scroll into an alchemy pot will imbue its magic into two rocks within the pot. This creates runestones and identifies the scroll!
journal.document.alchemy_guide.energy_food.title=Energy and Food
journal.document.alchemy_guide.energy_food.body=Many recipes require crystal alchemical energy, which is produced by deconstructing consumable items in an alchemy pot. More powerful items produce more energy, and energizing potions or scrolls also identifies them.\n\nSome recipes that require energy are magical, but these ones resemble traditional cooking.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotic_potions.title=Exotic Potions
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotic_potions.body=Potions can be mixed with energy to create exotic potions. They have more powerful effects, but are often useful in different ways.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotic_scrolls.title=Exotic Scrolls
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotic_scrolls.body=Exotic scrolls can be made with some energy and a scroll. They're a bit stronger and more expensive than exotic potions.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.bombs.title=Enhanced Bombs
journal.document.alchemy_guide.bombs.body=A standard black powder bomb can be mixed with a specific item to create an enhanced bomb.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.weapons.title=Enhancing Weapons
journal.document.alchemy_guide.weapons.body=Some of the lighter or more magical weapons can be used in alchemy!\n\nEach thrown weapon produces enough liquid metal to fully repair another weapon of the same level and tier.\n\nOne wand will produce enough arcane resin to upgrade two wands of the same level, but no higher than +3.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.brews_elixirs.title=Brews and Elixirs
journal.document.alchemy_guide.brews_elixirs.body=Brews and elixirs are advanced potions with a variety of effects, usually with a single use.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.spells.title=Spells
journal.document.alchemy_guide.spells.body=Spells are contained in crystals and provide a variety of effects, usually with multiple uses.

journal.document.special_seeds.title=Special Seeds Catalogue

journal.document.intros.title=Region Introductions
journal.document.intros.dungeon.title=Dungeon
journal.document.intros.dungeon.body=Many heroes have ventured into the dungeon before you from the city above, most have never been heard from again.\n\nIt is said that an ancient evil lurks in the depths, guarding the almighty Amulet of Yendor. Even now dark energy radiates from below, making its way up into the city.\n\nWill you conquer the dungeon and claim the amulet? It's time to start your own adventure!
journal.document.intros.sewers.title=Sewers
journal.document.intros.sewers.body=The upper floors of the dungeon actually constitute the city's sewer system.\n\nAs dark energy has crept up from below the usually harmless sewer creatures have become more and more ferocious. The city has had to send guard patrols down here to try and maintain safety for those above.\n\nThis place is dangerous, but at least the evil magic at work here is weak.
journal.document.intros.prison.title=Prison
journal.document.intros.prison.body=Many years ago a prison was built here to house dangerous criminals. Tightly regulated and secure, convicts from all over the land were brought here to serve time.\n\nBut soon dark miasma started to creep from below, twisting the minds of guard and prisoner alike.\n\nIn response to the mounting chaos, the city sealed off the entire prison. Nobody knows what became of those who were left for dead within these walls...
journal.document.intros.caves.title=Caves
journal.document.intros.caves.body=These sparsely populated caves stretch down under the abandoned prison. Rich in minerals, they were once a center of bustling trade and industry for the dwarven society below, but they were abandoned as the dwarves became obsessed with dark magic.\n\nThe caves are now mostly inhabited by subterranean wildlife, gnolls, tasteful statues, and derelict machinery; likely corrupted by the same power that has affected the regions above.
journal.document.intros.city.title=Dwarven Metropolis
journal.document.intros.city.body=The Dwarven Metropolis was once the greatest of all dwarven city-states. In its heyday the dwarves built wondrous machines of metal and magic that allowed their city to expand rapidly.\n\nThen, one day, the city gates were barred and nobody heard from the dwarves again. The few who escaped the city as it closed told stories of a mad warlock who stole the throne, and the terrible magic he had learned to harness.
journal.document.intros.halls.title=Demon Halls
journal.document.intros.halls.body=These deep halls of the Dwarven Metropolis have been twisted by dark magic. In the past these regions played host to the Dwarf King's court of elite warlocks, but now they seem to have been taken over by something even more sinister...\n\nAll sorts of horrific demonic creatures inhabit these halls, being led by some terrible dark power. If the King of Dwarves wasn't the source of the spreading corruption, whatever is down here must be.\n\nTread carefully, very few adventurers have ever descended this far...
journal.document.intros.abyss.title=The Abyss
journal.document.intros.abyss.body=You whisper to amulet as your soul descends into pure darkness...\n\nWelcome to Abyss. This is essentially endless mode: descend into bottomless dungeon, fight enemies and gather special chaosstones, which will contribute to your score. You can always stop by using amulet to escape the Abyss.\n\nGet as many chaosstones as you can!

journal.document.sewers_guard.title=Guard's Letters
journal.document.sewers_guard.new_position.title=My New Position!
journal.document.sewers_guard.new_position.body=85th of Autumn, 375\nDear Mom and Dad,\n\nI told you all the hard work at the city guard would pay off. I just got promoted!\n\nI've been invited to go on a royal envoy to the Rat Kingdom, the first one in fifteen years! I'm so excited! Rumors are that their king is a total hunk! Best of all, the pay is incredible!\nIt's all a bit secretive though, so I can't actually send this letter. It feels weird to not write to you, so I'm going to keep writing them anyway. Maybe I can show them to you one day.\n\nBest,\n- Sonya
journal.document.sewers_guard.dangerous.title=A Prolonged Descent
journal.document.sewers_guard.dangerous.body=88th of Autumn, 375\nDear Mom and Dad,\n\nSomething's going on. The sewers, typically incredibly safe, seem to be invested with monsters! Worse, the rats are hostile!\n\nThankfully the rest of my team really knows what they're doing. Our team captain, Thomas, is an expert at this. I'm trying to learn quickly so that I'm not too much of a burden, but he's the only one who can kill those stupid unhittable snakes thus far.\n\nThis is dragging on much longer than expected. I'm glad I can't send these now, I don't want you to worry.\n\nI'll keep safe,\n- Sonya
journal.document.sewers_guard.crabs.title=Giant Crabs?!
journal.document.sewers_guard.crabs.body=11th of Winter, 376\nDear Mom and Dad,\n\nAs if the rats weren't bad enough, deeper down there are giant crabs! One of them charged right past me and got Lee pretty badly before we killed it. Thomas says it's not my fault, but I know he's just trying to be nice to me.\n\nThankfully, on our way out we ran into an adventurer who had some spare sungrass salve. Lee might not have made it without that stuff.\n\nI saw the adventurer staring at a rose before they left, they said it was a royal gift from someone they were looking for.\n\nHopefully we find the Kingdom sooner rather than later, this is getting ridiculous.

journal.document.sewers_guard.nothing.title=There's nothing here...
journal.document.sewers_guard.nothing.body=13th of Winter, 376\n\nWe've reached the fifth depth, ostensibly where the throne room is, but there's nothing here.\n\nNot only isn't there any visible door leading to the throne room, we can't find any signs of life at all. No gnolls, no snakes, no crabs, not even any rats. Nothing. It's kind of spooky, and there's a weird miasma in the air.\n\nNevertheless, Thomas seems to believe the throne room might be near the entrance to the old prison, so that's our next stop.\n\nIt'll be alright. Thomas knows what he's doing.
journal.document.sewers_guard.not_worth.title=The Kingdom Has Fallen
journal.document.sewers_guard.not_worth.body=The Prison entrance was shut, and before we could investigate the walls for the throne room, we ran into some sort of massive ooze monster at the prison entrance. Before we could react it blasted us with magic. Thomas took most of it. He's gone.\n\nIt's plain to see that we'll never find the King. Something sinister is going on down here, and that...thing... being here while the higher floors are a mess means something terrible has happened to the King.\n\nI'm leaving these letters behind as a warning to others. Get out, and never look back.
journal.document.prison_warden.title=Warden's Journal
journal.document.prison_warden.journal.title=Keeping a Journal
journal.document.prison_warden.journal.body=1st of Spring, 362\n\nThis is the first entry in the work journal of prison warden Kiana Smith. With all that's been going on lately, I've decided to start a journal to keep my thoughts in order.\n\nWhile this prison was initially founded under the Rat Kingdom as a diplomatic favor, it's starting to feel more isolated down here. Lately it seems like some sort of organized disruption is happening. Inmates have been acting out for no reason and then refusing to explain why.\n\nSome of the guards are starting to say the place is haunted. I can't let my own people spread rumours, but I can't exactly blame them for being uneasy.\n- Smith
journal.document.prison_warden.recruits.title=New Recruits
journal.document.prison_warden.recruits.body=80th of Spring, 362\n\nAs promised, a bunch of new recruits arrived today. It seems like the usual, a few promising ones and lots of grunts who just want the pay. Still, having all this new muscle should help a lot with our recent unruly inmates.\n\nIn a job like this it's important to know who you can trust. One new hire, Thomas, seems especially promising. I need all the help I can get right now, so if he does well I'll see about getting him promoted quickly.\n- Smith
journal.document.prison_warden.mines.title=Sealing the Mines
journal.document.prison_warden.mines.body=54th of Winter, 363\n\nA group of engineers from the city came today, saying that they're here to seal off the old entrance to the mines below. I suppose the city doesn't want to bother maintaining the passage anymore. I wasn't informed beforehand, as usual.\n\nTheir head engineer also told me some nonsense about dwarven magic leaking in from the mines. I don't believe a word of it, that sounds like a mistake very much unlike His Majesty.\n\nThe situation is under much better control with our new staff, but the root of the problem still hasn't been addressed. Something is definitely affecting the inmates here, and knocking down a few walls isn't going to change that.\n- Smith
journal.document.prison_warden.rotberry.title=Rotberry Plant
journal.document.prison_warden.rotberry.body=23rd of Autumn, 363\n\nReceived a lovely present from Felix today. It's some sort of bright red shrub called a 'Rotberry'.\n\nI've mentioned how dreary this place is to him before, seems he was listening. According to him this plant actually dislikes light and water, so I just have to trim the leaves back once a month or so. Trimming it must be important though, he mentioned it a dozen times in his letter.\n\nOf course, Felix never does anything for free. He says that the seeds this thing produces are great for making wands, so naturally I owe him a few each time the plant produces some.\n- Smith
journal.document.prison_warden.no_support.title=No Support
journal.document.prison_warden.no_support.body=11th of Spring, 364\n\nWhat the hell is the city thinking? After urgently requesting help I've heard nothing, not even an empty apology like they usually send when my requests are denied.\nI know the king has been sleeping more, but how much does a guy have to sleep for him to let requests like this slip? Does he not have aides???\n\nMeanwhile the inmates continue to get worse, and some of the guards have even started to cause trouble. Do they plan to just let this keep getting worse until we're dealing with a riot!?\n\nThomas has stayed reliable as ever at least. His organizational help has been invaluable, and his idea to activate those old DM-100 units was regrettable but necessary. I'm confident I can get back on top of this situation, I just need some damned support!\n-Smith
journal.document.prison_warden.letter.title=Letter to Thomas
journal.document.prison_warden.letter.body=Thomas,\n\nYou've been a great friend, so I'm doing you a favour.\n\nWhen you start your shift tonight, lock and reinforce Tengu's cell, throw the key into some alcove, and get out. It doesn't matter if the other prisoners are unattended, pretty soon nobody will be able to leave this place. That freak has to stay secured though, if he escapes there's no telling what he'll do.\n\nTell nobody of this, and don't bother looking for me. A captain must go down with her ship.\n- Kiana
journal.document.caves_explorer.title=Explorer's Log
journal.document.caves_explorer.expedition.title=Expedition Start!
journal.document.caves_explorer.expedition.body=1st of Summer, 308\n\nToday begins our four week expedition into the abandoned dwarven mines! I have been commissioned by the King himself to explore the region. My chief goals are to find any untapped natural resources and to survey the caves for a potential prison construction project.\n\nWhile I am capable of defending myself, I have accepted an escort from the city guard at the king's insistence. They're a bunch of... frankly... rodents, but as long as they don't slow me down their presence is tolerable.\n\nWe are expected to clear the sewers and reach the mines by evening.\n- Archibald Drummond. Archmage, southern wizarding institute.
journal.document.caves_explorer.gold.title=So Much Gold!
journal.document.caves_explorer.gold.body=4th of Summer, 308\n\nOur first few days have been very fruitful indeed! After establishing a base camp, we set out exploring some of the upper areas of the abandoned mine. While there is plenty of useless clutter left by the dwarves-aside from the tasteful statues, of course-many of the cave walls are also teeming with gold!\n\nUnfortunately, we aren't the first ones here. The caves are a lawless mess rife with aggressive wildlife, and it seems packs of gnolls have an interest in the gold as well. I admit that I was unfair toward my guard escort, they have been much more capable explorers and bodyguards than I expected.\n\nEven with this success, we still have much of the mines left to explore.\n- Archibald
journal.document.caves_explorer.troll.title=Met a Troll
journal.document.caves_explorer.troll.body=11th of Summer, 308\n\nAfter beginning our exploration into the midsection of the mines, we ran into a friendly face! Well... relatively friendly. A cave troll has set up a little smithy there. He is gruff and not very talkative, but he brightened immediately when we informed him of the king's mission and even repaired our equipment at a steep discount!\n\nUnfortunately, the troll blacksmith has also informed us that all of this lovely gold isn't quite as good as it seems. He calls it 'dark gold' and it apparently rapidly degrades in sunlight. That would certainly explain why there were never any conflicts over the resources here.\n\nI suppose we need to delve a little deeper to see if there is anything more valuable.\n- Archibald
journal.document.caves_explorer.city.title=The City Entrance
journal.document.caves_explorer.city.body=21st of Summer, 308\n\nWe're now at the three week mark, and after spending much of the last ten days charting ever deeper, we have finally reached the bottom of the mines. We found various metal contraptions and a great gate which blocks entry to the old dwarven metropolis.\n\nThe blacksmith warned us about some of this machinery. It was apparently meant for area defense and has a tendency to activate when disturbed. We have no business in the city, and the metal would have minimal scrap value, so we thought it best to heed his warning and head back out.\n\nI must admit I was curious, but investigating down there certainly wasn't worth the risk.\n- Archibald
journal.document.caves_explorer.alive.title=It's Alive!
journal.document.caves_explorer.alive.body=23rd of Summer, 308\n\nOne of the dwarven machines came to life somehow! We were merely passing by when it charged and almost crushed two of our group with its huge metal fists. Luckily, I was carrying my prized wand of firebolt with me. A few well-aimed blasts from that and the beastly thing was reduced to scrap metal.\n\nWhat troubles me is that we did absolutely nothing to provoke the machine, it's as if it was trying to ambush us! I was sure that that all dwarven war machines had been destroyed years ago in the war...\n\nAt least I was able to offer some help to my companions for once.\n- Archibald
journal.document.caves_explorer.report.title=Final Report
journal.document.caves_explorer.report.body=28th of Summer, 308\n\nToday we will finish packing up our belongings and prepare to leave. Just in time as well, several of our group have begun having terrible nightmares following the incident with the aggressive machine. It's probably just fatigue, but their nightmares are all worryingly similar.\n\nIn summary, the upper areas of the mine are quite safe. If a use could be found for dark gold then mining it may be quite lucrative. The large open spaces would work very well for the city's construction plans as well. The lower mines are more dangerous however, and should be avoided.\n\nI'll write all this into my final report over the next few days.\n- Archibald
journal.document.city_warlock.title=Warlock's Journal
journal.document.city_warlock.treason.title=Treason?!
journal.document.city_warlock.treason.body=It is the 5th day of the 2nd month of the 33rd year of the age of magic. If an overworlder is reading this, it is sometime in Winter 264. My name is Thymor Zahir, loyal member of the royal court.\n\nToday, the presses are abuzz with the news that a member of the royal court has been arrested for attempted treason.\nI don't know how anyone could justify doing such a thing, but luckily His Majesty, in his infinite wisdom, seems to have seen through his plot.\n\nThe trial is in a week, though I'll be on vacation for it. I trust that the treasonous scum will be executed in due time, however.
journal.document.city_warlock.old_king.title=The King is Dead
journal.document.city_warlock.old_king.body=... The unthinkable has happened. Upon my return, I heard the tragic news that the King has passed?!\n\nIt seems that the treasonous criminal unleashed.... something at his trial, and now he's become the king amidst the power vacuum. Worse, none of the court seems to listen to me anymore! It's like they're mindless slaves or something!\n\nIn any case, I refuse to believe the King is dead, and even if he is, I will never accept THAT GUY as a king.\n\nI must mount a resistance as quickly as possible, before the New King's power reaches everyone. I refuse to let our glorious civilization fall to this megalomaniac!
journal.document.city_warlock.failure.title=Failure
journal.document.city_warlock.failure.body=It seems that I'm a fool as well. I'd assumed that the New King needed the court to submit to him willingly, but now I see that he has the power to control even those who resist him.\n\nI blindly brought all of the strongest opposition right to his doorstep so that he could personally turn them into his slaves. Now waves of his necrotic energy are washing through the city, instantly turning most into his supplicants.\n\nThe few who still have free will are fleeing. I have chosen to stay behind to observe as best I can and look for an opening. With the magic power I have I should be able to stay hidden and safe for some time.\n\nStrangely, the Kingdom seems to have developed a rat infestation. I wouldn't normally mention it, but the rats seem to move as if they are being coordinated somehow.
journal.document.city_warlock.more_powerful.title=More Powerful
journal.document.city_warlock.more_powerful.body=Keeping track of time has become difficult, but it has been about a week since my last entry. Our civilization has truly collapsed. The gates are shut, all functions of our society have ceased, and empty dwarven husks roam the halls.\n\nThroughout all of this, somehow, the New King is becoming even more powerful. Every day the force of his will becomes stronger, but it is also changing. I cannot describe it, but it feels as if he is no longer a dwarf at all.\n\nFurthermore, I think I'm going nuts: one of those rats seems bigger than the others, and its peculiar golden eyes seems familiar, somehow...
journal.document.city_warlock.new_power.title=War
journal.document.city_warlock.new_power.body=The army of rats has invaded! If the Metropolis had already seemingly fallen, it's definitely rubble now.\n\nAt this point, I'm convinced that this invasion has something to do with the Old King. But with that said, I don't believe they'll win: there's simply too many slaves, and the New King has a critical edge in magical weapons, while the invaders only have teeth and claws.\nNevertheless, the war is much closer than I expected, considering the power imbalance. It seems that the New King is distracted with something in the inner metropolis; how else would he have so much trouble dealing with this invasion?\n\nI regret to be so useless, but it is taking all my strength to even observe, but even this task must surely be helpful to my liege in some way.
journal.document.city_warlock.seen_it.title=I've Seen It
journal.document.city_warlock.seen_it.body=I have seen what lies below, but I cannot describe it. My hands shake uncontrollably as I try to put my thoughts into writing.\n\nWhy is this happening? Did the New King do this? It makes no sense. Perhaps his wanton use of power attracted it? Perhaps the war itself instigated this?\n\nI understand now why the Old King invaded, even with just an army of rats... I had hoped to save our civilization, but now I see that the entire world is at stake.\n\nThe rats have long since retreated, and I am too weak to go in search of them now... Woe! If only we'd coordinated, maybe.... \n\nSomehow, the New King is the lesser evil. I have no other choice, for the greater good I will surrender myself. Please guide me my king, use me as an instrument to hold Yog-Dzewa at bay!
journal.document.halls_king.title=???'s Journal
journal.document.halls_king.rejection.title=Rejection
journal.document.halls_king.rejection.body=IMBECILES!\n\nOver the last 33 years our kingdom has flourished with our new magical technology. We've learned how to summon elemental spirits and bend them to our will, but somehow now further experimentation is 'too dangerous'.\n\nI know what's really going on. The rejection of my theories has nothing to do with their merit and everything to do with the person who suggests them. They're probably all laughing at me behind my back, especially that golden-eyed dim-wit they call a king! Why must the gods bless such an individual with such unfathomable power, I don't know...\n\nWell no more! I don't care what they say, I will explore the furthest reaches of our universe alone, and keep everything I discover for myself! Surely there's something down there that can be used against him.\n- R.
journal.document.halls_king.amulet.title=The Amulet
journal.document.halls_king.amulet.body=I'VE DONE IT!\n\nI didn't know what I might find exactly, but what I discovered out there was beyond my wildest speculation. So much power, just sitting there ready to be taken, and it's all mine!\n\nWith this none of the fools in the court, not even that fool king, will dare oppose me. I'm just giddy thinking about all the different ways I could humiliate them. Hell, why stop there, I have enough power to destroy every last one of them if I want! That might be excessive, but I mustn't take too long deciding or they'll get suspicious.\n\nI think I'll call this great power the Amulet of Yendor!\n- R.
journal.document.halls_king.ritual.title=Imprisoned
journal.document.halls_king.ritual.body=HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?\nImmediately upon my return, the guards swarmed me and hauled my ass to prison. Apparently I've been accused of treason?!\n\nThis is a massive setback to my plans.... but I must persevere.... they haven't executed me yet, and I will see that imbecile one last time at the trial.\n\nI must make my move then. With the King gone, it will be child's play to take control of the court, and I will prove that all his pursuits and ideals were meaningless!\n\nALL WILL BOW BEFORE ME!\n-Future King of Dwarves (temporarily imprisoned)
journal.document.halls_king.new_king.title=A New King
journal.document.halls_king.new_king.body=I AM KING, AHAHAHAHAAA!\n\nIt worked almost perfectly. They brought me out, and as soon as I saw the King I let loose with the full power of the amulet before he could possibly counter with his own magic power. While it sadly didn't seem to kill him, the resulting curse was basically just as effective. No one will follow that rodent anymore, hehe...\n\nIn the chaos, I proposed to share my new power in a ritual to the court, and THE IDIOTS AGREED! In an instant they were transformed from a chorus of mocking voices to my new court of silent subjects!\n\nThymor was away on vacation and thus escaped my reach, but I can already feel the resistance force he is building. I think I'll allow him to continue, so that he can deliver all of his conspirators right to my door!\n\nOne thing bothers me however.... Those eyes of the king.... those golden beads... they haunt me... even in that form, I could tell he thought I was pitiful, WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE PITIFUL ONE... Well, I'll show HIM that I was always destined to be a better king than he could ever be...\n- New King of the Dwarves
journal.document.halls_king.thing.title=The Thing
journal.document.halls_king.thing.body=There's a problem. Thymor was dispatched without effort, but it seems my scrounging in the outer planes did not go unnoticed.\n\nSome... 'thing'... has been attracted to my world and is starting to force itself through at the bottom of the lower halls. To complicate things further, that is the exact location where I stored the amulet! Such a spiteful creature, why must it try to deny me my power when there is plenty out there still to take? Why not claim that bastard's territory in the depths above?\n\nI would charge in there and fight it.... but AN ARMY OF RATS HAS INVADED THE KINGDOM. I've got my hands full dealing with a two-front war here, but I WILL DEFEND MY PRIZE... IT IS MINE!!!
journal.document.halls_king.attrition.title=Attrition
journal.document.halls_king.attrition.body=The accursed rats have finally retreated, though not without destroying my best forces, ugh. At least that curse is paying itself off in spades; I doubt I'll see that miserable pest again for a least several hundred years.\n\nWith them dealt with, I have a plan for dealing with the thing. Its power is infinite, but its ability to encroach on this world is not. It's relying on minions and avatars to do its bidding while it tries to build enough power to take the amulet.\n\nWhile I don't possess the amulet physically I still have full control over its power. With the entire dwarven city at my disposal and the ability to use the higher floors as a distraction, I also have a numbers advantage, and I can distract them by letting their power through the city ruins to bother that invading fool. All I need to do is defend the amulet itself, and I can simply keep sending soldiers to prevent it from seizing the amulet and steadily win this war through attrition!\n\nI bet that fool of a king would never have lasted this long...\n\nI, RODNEY, KING OF DWARVES, WILL OUTLAST YOU YOG-DZEWA!

journal.document.terminus.title=R&D Journals
journal.document.terminus.no_food.title=Starvation Problems
journal.document.terminus.no_food.body=It has been known for quite a long time that some simulations struggle with supplying good food to their visitors. Their tastes are picky, and renewable supplies are bound to diminish in quality without proper care. Maybe using pure energy instead of organic assortment of nutrients could be used to feed and satisfy adventurers?
journal.document.terminus.no_armor.title=Degrading Protection
journal.document.terminus.no_armor.body=While quality of weapons was priority and focus for dungeon players to survive, the same cannot be said for protective clothes and sets. Abandoned and deteriorated, their ability to prevent physical harm is far from what they were used in the past. Repairing is off the limits due to sheer quantity of armor pieces and lack of workforce in those humanless simulations. Would it be viable to supply high quality steel and methods to produce it to improve the survivability?
journal.document.terminus.no_healing.title=Pharmaceutic Crisis
journal.document.terminus.no_healing.body=Healing and replenishment sorcery is vital part of anyone trying to survive in dungeon simulations. But many reviewers admit that it is far too easy to prevent any mistakes and obtain good score with just using potions to replenish their health. Eventually, the economic laws have demanded for healing supplies to be either reduced in size or be reduced in quality. The most researchers have chosen both, and it showed, how much visitors relied on those potions and consumables. Now all saved resources could be used for something else, right?
journal.document.terminus.no_herbalism.title=Weakening Plant Life
journal.document.terminus.no_herbalism.body=One strange property of all dungeon simulations was the resilience of plants. The ability to grow in brick floors and solid stone without any natural sunlight is nothing short of astonishing. However, here's a question: can a plant life, that survives against all odds in dark dungeons, be also an excellent source of herbs and dew? The answer is... yes, because of how much water and dirt between floors was there. So one of more advanced iterations of layouts reduced the nutrients for herbs and plants to point of no longer producing offspring. Some overseers were regretting crippling one of best cases of natural evolution, but what we can do to not break "balance" requirements?
journal.document.terminus.swarm_intelligence.title=Adaption and Sensuality
journal.document.terminus.swarm_intelligence.body=The monsters have shown the most benefit from reiteration and reinforcement processes, being able to navigate the floor of dungeons without any clues and avoiding deadly traps. But what they truly do the best is catching the players in groups and swarms, using their ability to corner anyone not fortunate enough to have the solution. So the next step forward would be having enemies coordinate with each other, even through obstacles, to attack the visitors at the same time. Should be easy to implement, but only the time will tell.
journal.document.terminus.darkness.title=When the Light is Going Low
journal.document.terminus.darkness.body=Usually, the visitors of dungeon loot simulators have good eyesight and can tell what is going on from various landmarks and lanterns. But if that wasn't always the case? What if some people had poor eyesight? What if lights don't last enough? What if clouds of dust or fog will envelop the depths? That's why we will provide a free flammable tool to provide better view of the dungeon in the next update. Those will only last for some time, so visitors will need to balance their torch consumption, improving the engagement.
journal.document.terminus.no_scrolls.title=Drastic Engagement Measures
journal.document.terminus.no_scrolls.body=Looks like the current balancing between various types of equipment and gear heavily depends on something called "scrolls of upgrade" in simulations: a way to make something slightly stronger with each application. Therefore, the best way to add more "balance" to dungeons is reducing amount of those scrolls. A simple, straightforward, yet very impactful. We wish other simulations and virtual realities were that easy to stabilize.
journal.document.terminus.champion_enemies.title=Adaption and Sensuality: Part II
journal.document.terminus.champion_enemies.body=Even with allowing monsters to group and call each other on attacking dungeon visitors, there is still a way to improve them without radically changing how they behave. By implementing a primordial chaos into evolution of dungeon's natural inhabitants, some of them were able to bond with it and refine its frequency, becoming the frequency's champion. Some frequencies were reported to be non-threatening, while others gave a lot of negative reviews on how much they impact the enemy's comparative strength, demanding further changes.
journal.document.terminus.stronger_bosses.title=Big Fishes
journal.document.terminus.stronger_bosses.body=The most powerful entities in the dungeons, called "bosses" by customers, have not been impacted by previous attempts of making enemies stronger, either due to them being alone in their quest to guard or their arena layouts. Fortunately, the team has written a basic, yet effective solution on making those biggest threats stronger than before. Faster abilities, better toughness... all kinds of tricks were suggested. And yet, it doesn't seem to change the ratings. Something must be wrong about our ways.
